# CoffeeShop_Chatbot
This is the code to create a simple chatbot using Deep Learning Algorithms.

The chatbot is designed to react to questions on ordering coffee and making a table reservation at a coffee shop. Just a few of the numerous "intents" or types of inquiries that are covered are greetings, ordering coffee, coffee variations, coffee sizes, coffee additives, coffee costs, specialty beverages, booking a table, location, and operation hours. For each goal, a list of potential user inputs (patterns) is provided, along with the chatbot's pertinent responses. For instance, if a user asks, "Can I order a coffee?the chatbot will understand the intent "order_coffee"and reply, "Of course, what size would you like your coffee?‚Äù.

| Intent | Expected Patterns | Expexted Responses |
|--------|-------------------|--------------------|
| greeting | Hi, Hello, Hey there, Good morning | ['Hello! How can I help you today?', 'Hi! What can I do for you?', 'Hey there! How can I assist you?']|
| order_coffee | Can I order a coffee?\nI want a coffee\nCan you make me a coffee?\nCoffee please | ['Sure, what type of coffee would you like?', 'Of course, what size would you like your coffee?', 'Certainly, would you like anything else with your coffee?'] |
